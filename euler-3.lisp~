;; Problem 3

;; The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

;; What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?

;; In number theory, the prime factors of a positive integer are the prime
;; numbers that divide that integer exactly, without leaving a remainder.


;; So we need to check all the numbers and for every number that divides into
;; our number to check we check if it is prime.
